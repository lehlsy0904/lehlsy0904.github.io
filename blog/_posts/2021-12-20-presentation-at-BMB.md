I completed my independent research project in Fall 2021. In this project, I specified unique groups of Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal ideaiton (SI), and suicidal behavior (SB) by using a large database from the ABCD study and compared behavior and brain activation during the cognitive tasks. I learned much about data analysis using python and R through this project, and also won a poster award!
