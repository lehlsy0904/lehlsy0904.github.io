# About me


Hello! Nice to meet you. I'm Eunhwi Lee, and I am a graduate student in [Computational Clinical Science Lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io). I received a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) with summa cum laude in Feburary 2022. Now, I major in clinical psychology and study computational psychiatry and clinical neuroscience.



I am broadly interested in the diagnosis and classification of psychiatric disorders, and also the development of individualized treatments. Especially, I want to investigate maladaptive decision making and addictive behavior by using neuroscientific approaches and computational methods.



I aim to become a clinical psychologist who can explain human mind in terms of dynamic structure-from genomics and circuits to behavior and self-report.



for more information, please check my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVl2pix0PN7ETZKTEQhL_ttjNlzkaV3H/view?usp=sharing)!
